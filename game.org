This will be an internal dev wiki for the progress of the game.

* TODO for "pre-alpha" version
** TODO move to doxygen or self-documenting syntax
** TODO main menu system
** TODO make at least 90 percent of the code compile
** TODO movable camera and easy MVPs attached to entities
** TODO terrain generation algorithm
** TODO recursive river hydroponics algorithm
multithreading and recursion/iteration requiredâ€¦
there are huge advantages to a hydroponic river terrain generation system.
it creates realistic river junctions and quality terrain biomes.
Try to see how much of the river logic can be put into coefficient matrices on the GPU
** TODO GLQuery composability
GLQueries should be easily extendable and not a hindrance to use.
The ideal setup: touching gl* functions shouldn't happen outside of the Engine source code!
** TODO write a shader using ShaderProgram
** TODO Start test suite

* TODOs that probably won't happen anytime soon
** Vulkan support
** Quality graphics
