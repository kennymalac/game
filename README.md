game engine
===========

FAQ (frequently asked questions)
---

**What is this?**
This is a work in progress game engine in development by Kenneth Malac. This engine might become subject to relicensing, but for now is released under a liberal license. This code is heavily untested and an abstraction warehouse â€” Do not blame me if you use my code and it breaks!

**What is required to compile this?**
I use C++14 syntax (using Clang on OSX). Please compile using cmake. Not tested on Windows.
Go ahead and modify the CMakeLists.txt if you have to.
In the future this engine will most likely require C++17 if necessary.

**Why do you have the brackets like that?**
I actually prefer it that way because of Lisperati, but right now I'm just testing it out. Not all of the code is bracketed wierdly. Cmake's format file is set to LLVM style otherwise.

**Why does this engine stink?**
It's not done yet. Click that freaking star button and get out of here!
