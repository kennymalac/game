game engine
===========

FAQ (frequently asked questions)
---

**What is this?**
This is a work in progress game engine in development by Kenneth Malac. This engine might become subject to relicensing, but for now is released under a liberal license. This code is heavily untested and an abstraction warehouse â€” Do not blame me if you use my code and it breaks!

**What is required to compile this?**
I use C++17. Please compile using cmake. Not tested on Windows.
Go ahead and modify the CMakeLists.txt if you have to.

**Why do you have the brackets like that?**
I actually prefer it that way because of Lisperati. Cmake's format file is set to LLVM style otherwise.

**Why does this engine stink?**
It's not done yet. Click that freaking star button and get out of here!
